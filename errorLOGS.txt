the upload directory was not specified that was why after clicking analyze button we were getting the error "MulterError: Unexpected Field"

so we had to connect to the upload directory "const uploadDir = path.join(__dirname, 'upload');" and the pass that directory to the multer configuration "dest: uploadDir"

// configure multer
const uploadDir = path.join(__dirname, 'upload');
// ensure upload directory exists
if (!fs.existsSync(uploadDir)) {
    fs.mkdirSync(uploadDir, { recursive: true });
}
const upload = multer({
    dest: uploadDir,
});
